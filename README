Kanban

I am creating a repository for a website that will help a user track important tasks, along with their due dates, that will change color to highlight if its date is coming up.

This repository will be stored on Github and can be accessed at https://vpvelthuizen.github.io/Kanban

This repository does not require any installs or special equipment to access, only a web browser.
